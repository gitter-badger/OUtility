## What is it?

The goal behind OUtility is to provide the everyday Java programmer with a rich collection of essential functions and classes, allowing them to spend less time figuring out the nitty gritty details and more time developing the actual high-level functionality of their software.

OUtility comes packed with a rapidly increasing amount of useful classes and utility methods, which are specifically designed to make YOUR code shorter, cleaner and more efficient!

## Using the library

OUtility is incredibly compact and easy to integrate into your new or existing projects! Simply download the .jar file from [here](http://www.filedropper.com/outility) and add it as a project reference. Need some step by step instructions? Check out the [wiki!](https://github.com/McFeelio/OUtility/wiki)

## We need you!

While OUtility is young I will be adding new functionality very quickly, however I am only one man and can only do so much! Have a couple handy utility classes that you can't go without? Simply fork this project and submit a pull request!
