# OUtility
Welcome to OUtility, your brand new everyday Java utility library!

* Since the project is brand new, this ReadMe is a very, very rough draft. Take all the information with a few grains of NaCl.

## What is it?

The goal behind OUtility is to provide the everyday Java programmer with a rich collection of essential functions and classes, allowing them to spend less time figuring out the nitty gritty details and more time developing the actual high-level functionality of their software.
